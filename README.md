- After encountering web development in [LIKELION](https://www.likelion.net/), I studied front-end development with ReactJS.
- Then, after conducting a [LevelDB study](https://github.com/Cho-SangHyun/leveldb-study) with embedded lab on campus with the idea of encountering other fields, more interest was gained in the backend field by analyzing what is happening behind users at the source code level and measuring their performance.

- studying cloud services provided by aws.
- interested in Linux, so I'm applying for and taking Linux related classes at university even though I've already filled all my grades.
