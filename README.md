# Hi there 👋
## I'm SangHyun Cho
As a software developer, I started my career Since 2024, working in financial industry. I always try to think of "nevertheless" rather than "I can't help it," and i try to melt my expertise to solve problems by designing and developing systems, even considering unexpected errors.  
<br>  

In addition, I am confident in communicating technical problems by solving them in human language. Through years of development blogging and presentation experience in two in-house academic clubs, I have the ability to easily convey complex technical content.  

<br>  

## I'm currently..
- 💻 maintaining the in-house system in financial industry
- 📝 writing blog posts in Korean at https://jofestudio.tistory.com
